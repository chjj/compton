.SH DESCRIPTION
.B compton
is a compositor based on Dana Jansens' version of xcompmgr (which itself was
written by Keith Packard). It includes many improvements over the original
xcompmgr, including window frame opacity, inactive window transparency,
and shadows on argb windows.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-d\ display
Specifies the display to manage.
.TP
.BI \-r\ radius
Specifies the blur radius for client-side shadows.
.TP
.BI \-o\ opacity
Specifies the opacity for client-side shadows.
.TP
.BI \-l\ left-offset
Specifies the left offset for client-side shadows.
.TP
.BI \-t\ top-offset
Specifies the top offset for client-side shadows.
.TP
.BI \-I\ fade-in-step
Specifies the opacity change between steps while fading in.
.TP
.BI \-O\ fade-out-step
Specifies the opacity change between steps while fading out.
.TP
.BI \-D\ fade-delta
Specifies the time (in milliseconds) between steps in a fade.
.TP
.BI \-c
Enable client-side shadows on windows.
.TP
.BI \-f
When \-c is specified, enables a smooth fade effect for transient windows like
menus, and for all windows on hide and restore events.
.TP
.BI \-C
When \-c is specified, attempts to avoid painting shadows on panels and docks.
.TP
.BI \-G
When \-c is specified, attempts to avoid painting shadows on
drag-and-drop windows.
.TP
.BI \-F
When \-f is specified, also enables the fade effect when windows change their
opacity, as with transset(1).
.TP
.BI \-b
Attempts to fork to background after registered composition
manager.  Still sits in foreground if fork failed.  Maybe useful
if you computer is too fast, in which case some programs
requiring a composite manager may have started before composite
manager is ready.
.TP
.BI \-i\ opacity
Specifies inactive window transparency. (0.1 - 1.0)
.TP
.BI \-e\ opacity
Specifies window frame transparency. (0.1 - 1.0)
.TP
.BI \-S
Enables synchronous operation.  Useful for debugging.
